usage is: cheapres.py -i input_file.asm -o output_file.asm.

Omitting the output overwrites the input (which can be regenerated at will probably)

Dependencies are kept to their minimum (no other python modules than already existing builtins, maybe it would even run on amiga in python 2.4 with minimum adaptations).


FAQ

Q: how cheapres recognize the different libraries bases? Do you look for specific text like ExecBase, IntuitionBase is their a list? Or is it done differently?

A: ExecBase, IntuitionBase, GraphicsBase... basically name of the lib with first letter uppercased. Ex: lowlevel.library => LowlevelBase.
   You can manually set them if the program uses a proxy routine to open the libraries (often happens in C programs)
